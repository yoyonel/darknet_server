- Packaged this repo to decent Python package project/application ! (setup.py, MANIFEST, ...)
- Refactor the python code (server, client)
- Refactor Dockerfile, docker-compose and scripts
    - Separate darknet building and darknet_server deployement/building
- Remove coupling with OpenCV2 and the server. OpenCV is used just for rendering image result (not processing).
